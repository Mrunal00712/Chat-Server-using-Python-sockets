# Chat-Server-using-Python-sockets
The Chat Server project enables bidirectional communication between two instances (B and D) by utilizing Python's socket programming.   
It establishes a server-client model where both instances can act as both the server and the client simultaneously,   
allowing them to exchange messages in a chat-like manner.
